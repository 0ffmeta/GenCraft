<h1> GenCraft </h1>

<h2>This modpack got started because I couldn't play the Java version of Minecraft with a controller =^I</h2>

    In this pack I've tried to create a version of modded Minecraft that doesn't overcomplicate things, focusing on immersing the player into the world. I've found that a lot of modpacks include game mechanics that break the open-world survival aspect of Minecraft, while others are missing the increased depth of creation/crafting that some of those same mods provide. With this in mind, I tried to separate these two modes of the game and consider how each mod I added effected both the building/creative aspect of the game, as well as how it would change the open-world survival aspect and its difficulty. Easy is never fun. Although I've still got a long ways to go on the balance of the progression arc, I have done my best to try and make sure that both forms of playing the game can be enjoyed.

    Along with this, I've also included various mods for Minecraft players that aren't interested in either building or combat. Some people just don't really enjoy the process of a new build, and aren't really into smacking zombies, I get it. From visual mods and resource/shader packs for the aesthetic, to various new mob spawns and world gen mods, this pack also expands exploration and the 'beauty' of the landscape itself. This plus the difficulty mods and new boss/dimension mods for more variations to the late-game, along with the Create series and other mods that add various new blocks for more variety means this pack has a little bit of (almost) everything. An enhanced kitchen sink pack with none of the fluff if you will!

Playing with a controller is highly recommended! Yes there are things you can't do with the controller, I'd still keep a keyboard handy for when the need arises =^)
